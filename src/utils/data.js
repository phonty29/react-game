You have come to an interesting decision.\n   The next time your friends come, you will monitor the order of their entry into the bathroom. After every friend uses the bathroom, you ask each of them if he saw the stolen object when he went into the bathroom. After comparing the answers, you have to decide which friends should be invited next time and which ones should not. If at the end there are two friends and one of them is a thief, then you have lost. You will win if you get rid of all the rotten friends."
